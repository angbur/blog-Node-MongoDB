I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine.\r\n\r\nI am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now.\r\n\r\nWhen, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath",

The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment.\r\n\r\nHis many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. \"What's happened to me? \" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls.\r\n\r\nA collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops",
